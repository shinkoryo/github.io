# Deep Learning Book Series · 2.1 Scalars Vectors Matrices and Tensors

## Introduction
This is the first post/notebook of a series following the syllabus of the linear algebra chapter from the Deep Learning Book by Goodfellow et al.. This work is a collection of thoughts/details/developements/examples I made while reading this chapter. It is designed to help you go through their introduction to linear algebra. For more details about this series and the syllabus, please see the introduction post.

This first chapter is quite light and concerns the basic elements used in linear algebra and their definitions. It also introduces important functions in Python/Numpy that we will use all along this series. It will explain how to create and use vectors and matrices through examples.

## 2.1 Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors
Let’s start with some basic definitions:

* A scalar is a single number
* A vector is an array of numbers.
